## Project Completion Todo

### Phase 1: Analyze existing project structure and requirements
- [x] Review provided files (`app.py`, `requirements.txt`, `.gitignore`)
- [x] Understand current functionality (YouTube video download)
- [x] List all requested technologies and their purpose

### Phase 2: Set up development environment and dependencies
- [x] Create a virtual environment
- [x] Install existing dependencies from `requirements.txt`
- [x] Install new dependencies for FastAPI, Celery, Redis, FFmpeg, SoX, Google Translate API, Google TTS, Cloudflare R2
- [x] Install system dependencies (FFmpeg, SoX, Redis)
- [x] Verify installations and start Redis service

### Phase 3: Implement core audio/video processing functionality
- [x] Migrate Flask to FastAPI
- [x] Integrate FFmpeg for video/audio manipulation (e.g., format conversion, extraction)
- [x] Integrate SoX for audio cleaning
- [x] Ensure yt-dlp functionality is maintained within FastAPI
- [x] Create service architecture with proper separation of concerns

### Phase 4: Integrate AI services for speech processing
- [x] Integrate OpenAI Whisper for speech-to-text transcription (alternative to WhisperX)
- [x] Integrate Google Translate API for text translation
- [x] Integrate Google TTS for Hindi voice synthesis (with AWS Polly as alternative)
- [x] Create AI workflow service for complete processing pipeline
- [x] Add AI service endpoints to FastAPI application

### Phase 5: Implement storage and file management
- [x] Configure Cloudflare R2 for S3-compatible storage
- [x] Implement logic for uploading processed files to R2
- [x] Generate signed URLs for secure downloads from R2
- [x] Create fallback local storage service
- [x] Add storage management endpoints to FastAPI

### Phase 6: Set up task queue and workflow automation
- [x] Integrate Celery for background task processing
- [x] Configure Redis as a message broker for Celery
- [x] Create task modules for video, audio, AI, and storage operations
- [x] Implement task routing and queue management
- [x] Add progress tracking and error handling for tasks
- [x] Implement n8n for workflow automation (created workflow templates - requires external n8n setup)

### Phase 7: Configure deployment and containerization
- [x] Create Dockerfile for the FastAPI application
- [x] Ensure all dependencies are correctly packaged in the Docker image
- [x] Create docker-compose.yml for full stack deployment
- [x] Configure Nginx reverse proxy for production
- [x] Create Railway deployment configuration
- [x] Add startup scripts and environment configuration
- [x] Create comprehensive documentation

### Phase 8: Test the complete application and deliver results
- [x] Conduct unit and integration tests for all functionalities
- [x] Verify end-to-end workflow (download -> process -> AI -> store -> download)
- [x] Test system dependencies (FFmpeg, SoX, Redis, Whisper)
- [x] Verify FastAPI application startup and basic endpoints
- [x] Create comprehensive test suite for deployment validation
- [x] Provide instructions for deployment and usage
- [x] Deliver the completed project files and documentation
